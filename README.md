# Install-Oracle-instant-client-21-cx-oracle-.sh

I needed to install Oracle instant client 21 and cx_Oracle on several machines, so I created this script to make the deployment easier. I hope it is useful for someone, at least to save some time searching for documentation on how to install.

How to run it:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make the script executable: `sudo chmod +x install-Oracle.sh`.
3. Run the script with superuser privileges: `sudo ./install-Oracle.sh`.

Feel free to edit the script as you wish :)
